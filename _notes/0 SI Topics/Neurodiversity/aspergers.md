(much of the autistic community is very against the now-defunct-in-many-countries-including-the-US diagnosis of Aspergers because other than science showing it's not actually a separate thing from the rest of autism, it's named after someone who supposedly was a nazi (tho as a history nerd, I have asked and never recieved actual historical evidence for this beyond the fact he stayed in Germany and didn't speak out against them while they were in power -- though he did seem to send at least one autistic child with higher support needs to their death at a camp (unclear if he was aware that it would lead to death), which is still obviously horrific, despite how much he worked to protect all the "Aspergers" kids under his care)
