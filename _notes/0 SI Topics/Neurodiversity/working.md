Wont be sabotaged by my ADHD in 1-1.5 years like every other job i've had. \*dreams\*

  

I'm absolutely willing to take a job that I \*can\* do for even that long, ofc. But the dream would be to find a job that is engaging enough that my brain doesn't stop producing dopamine after 6 months-year and thus my executive functions don't work and I get fired for simple ADHD mistakes, like always.

  

(my office jobs were lease analyst under accounting (LOL i have dyscalculia & a deep hatred of math!!!) and title searching (which was just pulling up mortgages and house titles all day every day). I've done retail too and that was a disaster. Too much orthostatic intolerance and a loathing of sales for that!

  

(I just deleted a long-ass rant about how people thing we just feel we're "better than \[boring\] jobs" and that is ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. Just trust me, when ADHDers are bored our dopamine stops and our brains can no longer run their executive functions, which are necessary for jobs. Willpower is POWERED by dopamine, too, btw :p.)

And I can't \*really\* follow through with career dreams, since i have a $7k hold on my college transcripts so I can't even go back to school to retool ;\_; But maybe I can do \*something\* i don't hate? And can pay a living wage? and most importantly: Wont be sabotaged by my ADHD in 1-1.5 years like every other job i've had. I'm absolutely willing to take a job that I \*can\* do for even that long, ofc. But the dream would be to find a job that is engaging enough that my brain doesn't stop producing dopamine after a year and thus my ADHD goes haywire and I get fired for simple ADHD mistakes.

  

I come from a factory-working family who values "hard work" more than anything else about a person (do they EVEN value anything else?!) and so TRUST ME I know perfectly well what NTs think of ADHDers in these situations. "Just take whatever job! you don't have to like it!"

  

I can't express to you how frustrating it is to have a DISABILITY that people refuse to understand as anything but choice, laziness, and entitlement.

  

I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ANY JOB!!!!!!!!!! Literally almost every problem I have would be solved by that!!

  

I don't want a job i'm interested in because i'm too good for boring jobs. It's because i get FIRED from jobs as soon as the novelty wears off and my brain gets bored. I don't choose to start forgetting things or messing things up, or leaving cash out of the cashbox or have drastic decreases in my work speed and increases in my errors. BECAUSE I HAVE A EFFED-UP-DOPAMINE CONDITION and dopamine is what runs all that stuff! Interest and novelty produces dopamine, and that's why adhders usually do well at first in new jobs.

  

It's the \*maintaining\* that which requires intrinsic dopamine release from the work, which isn't a choice. You either like a thing or you don't.
