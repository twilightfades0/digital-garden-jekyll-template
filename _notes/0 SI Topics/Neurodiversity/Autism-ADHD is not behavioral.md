I go from 0 to 100 when i see autism or ADHD listed as behavioral disorders. They absolutely are NOT. Yet SO MANY PEOPLE, including professionals, ignorantly categorize them as such.

  

My POTS makes me sit on the couch most of the time bc i get out of breath just standing. Spending a lot of time on the couch is a behavior. That does not make my Autonomic Nervous System disorder a behavioral disorder.

  

No one person can represent all the flavors of autistic, but personally, the reason I didn't look anyone in the eye until I was in high school was because I had no clue at all that I was "supposed to." i had to train myself (painfully, & didn't process a damn word a single person said to me during that very forced eye contact for YEARS.)

  

For me that was a behavior, but forcing myself to stare into people's eyeballs did not "help my autism," lololol. My genetics and neurological operating system remain the same, thankyouverymuch, tho it sure as hell raised my anxiety levels (and it's a good thing that was all self-imposed goal or I'd mega-loathe whoever made me go through it).

  

And, like, everyone talks about "impaired eye contact" in autism like it's a \*THING\* but then it's also ubiquitous in ADHD and it's so \*not a thing\* it's like, never talked about anywhere. Doctors and experts and most parents are unconcerned. Of course we don't make eye contact, we can't even keep our thought-train on its track, or our bodies still/in the chair.

  

But when it's an autistic kid, "oh god, quick, fix them! so tragic! He needs help!!1\`~" (Also, most autistics have adhd, soooo...). So much of this stuff is truly from an ableist gaze from the extremely abelist medical profession (yes, ableist (AF), it's not jut my opinion, this is a widespread and well documented/written about thing)

  

But also, #1 problem: The diagnostic criteria is behavioral, for a non-behavioral condition, and it leads to a LOT of underdiagnosis. Including autistics having trouble having their own kids diagnosed (it's genetic, if you weren't aware) because they don't show
