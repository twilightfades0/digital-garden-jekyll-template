Hey Jared! I  you, and as an ADHDer, research nerd, and advocate, I hope this can start a conversation & you take this opportunity to learn some about ADHD 

  

(PS CO DESPERATELY needs more supports for ADHD adults! It's a neurodevelopmental disability like autism (which also has NO SUPPORTS IN THIS STATE for adults without intellectual disability!!) and in fact they both have huge overlap, including genetic/biological and extremely common comorbidity (and critical underdiagosis in ADHDers bc symptoms/traits are so similar). In general we ADHDers (its NOT a children's disorder!!) are chronically under/unemployed + overly incarcerated + have chronic housing instability, etc and WE DONT HAVE A SINGLE SUPPORT to help us!! If any of your staffers (or you!) want to discuss this pls send me a message, bc \*I\* def want to discuss it!  )

  

Now, there are two major things here:

  

1\. Some ADHD stuff are \*traits\* and some are "symptoms". My meds help my symptoms (executive dysfunction), but they don't alter my ADHD traits (which are absolutely inseparable from who I am as a person and what my personality is like, and i LOVE those things about myself, and my family members and fellow ADHD friends! I would not change them for the world-- but I also wouldn't give up my adhd meds for the world, because they help my executive functioning.

  

The thing with talking about ADHD as if it's a bad thing to be avoided is to concentrate purely on the executive dysfunction and ignore the neurotype. Leonardo DaVinci was ADHD AF (out of HUNDREDS of paintings/projects he started, he literally only finished 15, as one example of many for him alone of why YES sometimes, esp with ADHD you really can diagnose historical people ðŸ˜‚) But ADHD people are heavily represented in arts and (pre-Academia's current abelism) science and it should never be seen as something to reduce! We're an important thread in the fabric of humanity!

  

\*\*\*\*BUT,\*\*\*\* (#2 as a comment to break up wall of text)

  
2\. There are things that can be done to reduce how much we STRUGGLE (either from inherent executive dysfunction, or from functioning in a world so EXTREMELY hostile to ADHDers- built for brains opposite to ours, with no supports except sometimes (very expensive!!!) medication) and YES PLEASE to that.

  

So nature reducing the "symptomaticness" of kids and adults who are no less ADHD, great! We desperately need more opportunities to reduce ADHDers level of over- and under- stimulation and help us learn to self-regulate (esp as kids) in addition to outward accommodations/assists

  

! Tho that brings an issue researchers have with our current DSM-- it only catches people who are struggling, and people who have more supports and scaffolding and accommodations are less likely to qualify for the diagnosis, which can lead to headlines like these-- but that's because the diagnostic criteria is not scientific and is only based on what the abled doctors \*noticed was "wrong"\* with us, and it isn't based on the identifying features of our neurology that exist whether or not we are getting help/accommodations/ living in a situation that allows us to struggle less.
