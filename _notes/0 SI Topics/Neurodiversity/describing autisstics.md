This person certainly isn't aware of it, but she is exactly describing autistics. Like, 100%, I work from the default assumption when i meet people like that that they're autistic (officially diagnosed or not), because it's very likely. And the second tweet especially made my heart drop a bit because that is just so us, and so me. it's even part of the general definitions of "impairments" in autism, having "overly formal and precise language."

  

..Though it's not really an impairment (tho being unaware of it might be), it's an adaptation, because the world misunderstands us constantly, we MUST be precise. \*plus\* most of us have ADHD so we write a lot as well. All our lives we've been misunderstood and our lives made harder because of it, so we've learned that we need to clarify any possible misunderstandings before they happen by being very exacting the first time we explain things.

  

This is even draft two of this comment because I did the same thing myself, even as I was talking about it, lol. Women do it all the time on the internet too (having trained myself out of doing it for the most part (trust, i know I still come off plenty awkward lol, but usually \*because\* some of my original words can't be accurately replaced in draft 2+) i am hyper aware of it in others) but women are more likely to notice when guys do it because of the additional mainsplaining feel-- and people socialized as girls/women have had more pressure to notice and change that. Like, E seems very unselfconcious of the fact that he does that (he can spend HOURS a day replying to people who are wrong on the internet-- not in an asshole way at all, but definitely in this kind of way.) I spend too much time on all that too, though the vast majority is writing, deleting, re-writing until I feel like I sound enough like a normie to not get made fun for awkward speech.

..Though it's not really an impairment (tho being unaware of it might be), it's an adaptation, because the world misunderstands us constantly, we MUST be precise. All our lives we've been misunderstood and our lives made harder because of it (people literally ARE hostile adversaries to us way too often-- and for everyone too often on the internet in general as well), so we've learned that we need to clarify any possible misunderstandings before they happen by being very exacting the first time we explain things. (\*plus\* most of us have ADHD so we write a lot as well :-x)

  

This is even draft two (edit, more like 2.5+? now?) of this comment because I did the same thing myself, even as I was talking about it, lol. Women do it all the time too (having trained myself out of doing it for the most part (trust, i know I still come off plenty awkward lol, but usually \*because\* some of my original words can't be accurately replaced in draft 2+) i am hyper aware when i notice it elsewhere) but women are more likely to notice when guys do it because of the additional mainsplaining feel-- and people socialized as girls/women have had more pressure to notice and change that so are probably more likely to "edit" themselves into more casual sounding comments, like I try to. E absolutely can come off like this, not too bad with word choices, but he can accidentally spend an entire day writing an essay in reply to someone on the internet, literally.

  

I'm over explaining even now for the same reason.

She is exactly explaining autistics. Autistics socialized as girls/women have more social pressures which make us more likely to recognize how awkward neurotypicals/allistics can think we are and thus more likely edit the shit out of our comments to seem less like this (this is draft 3 of this comment for me), but cis men have less of that and so it does seem more numerous with them. But, it's still, for a huge chunk, if not the majority of us, it's our natural way of communicating, and there's nothing wrong with it (tho there can be plenty wrong with *what* they're saying in this way, obvs).  

But, this is even part of the general list of "impairments" in autism, having "overly formal/stilted and precise language." 

Autism isn't rare, It's common (and distressingly underdiagnosed), so it's not unlikely that most (at least) of the kind of people she's talking about are indeed autistic, and she's not making fun of them* for being.. idk overly invested men talking on the internet, but she's making fun of autistic communication style. 

(us, this is 100% me too, but I can spend over an hour drafting a comment to make it less and less awkward, not that i ever get it 100%.. bc some formal words and such are necessary for precise communication and that's fine with me)

As an autistic, partnered with a guy autistic who can spend full days writing essays in response to someone's FB comment or whatever, and being in all my groups and shit-- I say this with confidence.

She's making fun of autistics here (on accident, I have little doubt!). 

  What she's describing is evne part of the general list of "impairments" in autism, having "overly formal/stilted and precise language." (and since most autistics are ADHD too, that often comes with writing way too much as well). And while she thinks she's just making fun of.. idk, awkward? overly-invested? men here, this is something countless autistics of all genders gets made fun of/bullied for  when we're kids-- and not uncommonly in adulthood, too.

  

As someone socialized as female, I ended up more aware/ self-concious about how i sound like this, and I/similar folks have worked conciously at reducing/hiding it so we don't get made fun of/judged (Gee why do non-cis-men autistics have higher social anxiety?? ðŸ¤” ) which is part of why it seems like more of a guy thing (also, confirmation bias.) 

  

But, it's still much/most? of our natural communication style. And it's a source of self conciousness and embarasment/shame for many (I even got my annoying burning red face of embarassment/ shame/lowkey distress when reading this post.. just because it's *such* a thing that I've always been self-concious about (self-loathing when young)) my whole life, and the exact thing I too-frequently spend HOURS a day conciously trying to mask (via editing my comments before I post especially... and this is my 5th draft of this comment in like an hour an a half+ ( woops D: ) for this comment!). :(


I hope this doesn't come off as negative towards you, Shelby! I don't mean it that way at all- I just wanted to share these thoughts in light of the post i made this morning (... oops, it's set to me only! lol. *adds it here*) Because just like any other -isms, people can't always recognize abelism if we don't talk about stuff like this first, and let people know when they are seeing but not recognizing forms of disability! And I thank you for being a person i feel safe enough actually commenting like this with. <3 <3

(iirc you deal with RSD too, so as a preface I want to say I'm not directing any bad feels twoards you in the least, and even I laughed at the first tweet.. til the second one was about me, and activated \*my\* RSD, ðŸ˜…. I just wanna throw out some info for everyone who sees this, esp in light of the attached picture I saw earlier today for #AutismAcceptanceMonth!  And i thank you for being someone i feel safe enoguh posting this with!  )

  

What she's describing is even part of the general list of "impairments" in autism, having "overly formal/stilted/outdated and precise language." (and since most autistics are ADHD too, that often comes with writing way too much, too). She couldn't have made it more fitting to that (my) type of autistic if she tried.

  

So while she thinks she's just making fun of.. idk, awkward? overly-invested? men here, she's really making fun of something countless autistics of all genders for the same thing we got made fun of/bullied for when we were kids -- and not uncommonly in adulthood, too.

  

  

As someone socialized as female, I ended up more aware/ self-concious about how i sound like this, and I/similar folks have worked conciously at reducing/masking it so we don't get made fun of/judged (Gee why do non-cis-men autistics have higher social anxiety?? ðŸ¤” ) which is part of why it seems like more of a guy thing (also, confirmation bias.) But, it isn't. It's part of our natural communication style(s).

  

And it's a big source of self consciousness and embarrassment/shame for many (I even got my annoying burning red face of embarrassment/ shame/low-key distress when reading the second tweet.. just because it's \*such\* a thing that I've always been self-conscious about (self-loathing when young)) my whole autistic-ass life (ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜­ ). This exact thing is \*exactly\* the kind of thing I frequently can spend HOURS a day consciously trying to mask if i let myself have a "facebook day" (always on accident).. (..this is my 6.5+th draft of this comment in almost two hours ðŸ˜­ ( woops), for example).

  

  

  

Just like any other -isms, people can't always recognize abelism if we don't talk about stuff like this first, and let people know when they are seeing but not recognizing forms of disability! And autism is considered a language/communication/social disability, after-all. So thank you for being a person i feel safe enough actually commenting like this with.

E loses even more time than I do on comments-- but he's the type of autistic guy who she's making fun of (tho as a rando, she wouldn't know from seeing one tweet before or whatever that he talks like that all the time, and it has nothing to do with intellectual superiority (in general, ofc douchenozzles come in every neurology), he's just a phd-level autistic from a family of people with advanced degrees, and that's just how he talks. (I'm constantly defining his words to R for example, because, as is stereotypical of autism, he doesn't shift his style of communication based on the audience as much as neurotypicals would and he uses that same vocabulary on his own 9 year old without even realizing that he's using words/concepts his kid doesn't know.

She's making fun of autistics here (albiet without realizing it, I presume~).

So while she thinks she's just making fun of.. idk, awkward? overly-invested? men here, really she's making of countless autistics of all genders for the same thing were made fun of/bullied/ostraciszed for when we were kids -- and not uncommonly in adulthood, too (esp online). (but of course douchenozzles can come in all neurotypes, it doesn't excuse any bullshit that might be presented in that way.. just the format, which in of itself NTs tend to take issue with.)

  

But, like, what she's describing is even part of the general list of "impairments" in autism- having "overly formal/stilted/outdated and precise language." (and since most autistics are ADHD too, it's often too long (like this one, sorry )). She literally couldn't have made her description more fitting to this (my) type of autistic if she tried.

  

this is kind of like the "hey trump is human scum, but if you call him fat or intellectually disabled etc-- you're not really insulting him, he can't hear you, but the fat/ people with intellectual disabilities, etc around you see what you really think about them."

  

It's a big source of self consciousness and embarrassment/shame for many of us (I even got my annoying burning red face of embarrassment/ shame/low-key distress when reading the second tweet.. just because it's \*such\* a thing that I've always been self-conscious about (self-loathing when young)) my whole autistic-ass life (ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜­ ). And this is also \*exactly\* the kind of thing I frequently can spend HOURS consciously trying to mask if i let myself have a "facebook day" (always on accident) and actually reply to stuff.. (..this is my 6.5+th draft of this comment in almost two hours ðŸ˜­ ( woops), for example ðŸ˜­. And this is pretty common when I let myself actually read through my feed (which is why i don't very much anymore)  ).

  

Anyway, just like any other -isms, people can't always recognize abelism if we don't talk about stuff like this first, and let people know when they are seeing but not recognizing forms of disability! And autism is considered a language/communication/social disability, after-all. So I am sorry for writing so much, but hey.. it's #AutismAcceptanceMonth ? (also i refuse to let myself spend any more time editing this comment, i have things to do! D: ) ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
