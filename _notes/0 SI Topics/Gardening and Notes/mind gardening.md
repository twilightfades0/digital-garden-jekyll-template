> \[Digital gardens are\] inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.

> They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing. It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites * "should be." *

Digital/mind gardens are for everyone, but they are especially perfect for ADHDers like myself, who were blessed with the lovely combination of "I have omg **so many** thoughts and ideas I need to share!!" + "I can't post anything on my blog unless it's a perfectly crafted essay, also I definitely don't have time/patience to do that." 

-> Page not finished?  It's not *supposed* to be! It's a seed, it's meant to grow.
