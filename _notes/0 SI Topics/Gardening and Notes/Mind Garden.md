What are **Digital Gardens** (aka **Mind Gardens**)?

In the words of gardening queen [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/):

<p class="css-y4yo6t e110qc8d0">They're not following the same conventions as what we've come to know as the "personal blog". Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.</p><p>They're collections of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date.  They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations.  They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.</p>

<p class="c0">So a year ago I would have thrown the link [to an article about gun ownership & mass shootings] to Twitter with a damning summary of the study, and everyone would have known I was a good liberal and retweeted it to prove that they were good liberals and if you listened closely you could hear our collective neurons harden.</p>
<p class="c0">But for the past year I’ve been experimenting with another form of social media called federated wiki. And it’s radically changed how I think about online communication and collaboration. <p>
<p class="c0">[...] just imagine that instead of blogging and tweeting your experience you wiki’d it. And over time the wiki became a representation of things you knew, connected to other people’s wikis about things they knew.</p>
<p class="c0">So when I see an article like this I think — Wow, I don’t have much in my wiki about gun control, this seems like a good start to build it out and I make a page.</p>
