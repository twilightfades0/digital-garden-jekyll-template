<p class="css-y4yo6t e110qc8d0">They're not following the same conventions as what we've come to know as the "personal blog". Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.</p><p>They're collections of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date.
