What are **Digital Gardens** (aka **Mind Gardens**)?

In the words of gardening queen [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/):

<p class="css-y4yo6t e110qc8d0">They're not following the same conventions as what we've come to know as the "personal blog". Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.</p><p>They're collections of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date.  They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations.  They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.</p>

<p class="c0">So a year ago I would have thrown the link [to an article about gun ownership & mass shootings] to Twitter with a damning summary of the study, and everyone would have known I was a good liberal and retweeted it to prove that they were good liberals and if you listened closely you could hear our collective neurons harden.</p>
<p class="c0">But for the past year I’ve been experimenting with another form of social media called federated wiki. And it’s radically changed how I think about online communication and collaboration. <p>
<p class="c0">[...] just imagine that instead of blogging and tweeting your experience you wiki’d it. And over time the wiki became a representation of things you knew, connected to other people’s wikis about things they knew.</p>
<p class="c0">So when I see an article like this I think — Wow, I don’t have much in my wiki about gun control, this seems like a good start to build it out and I make a page.</p>

This site is my digital garden wiki, where I can consolidate some of my thought and writing, as well as expand on it, dig deeper, and be able to easily link back to the thought and reading I've done on the subject later. 

And, most importantly for me, it is *allowed* to be messy.

Blog posts are proper essays. It's hard for my and my ADHD brain to sit down and whip up a polished essay when I want to blog, so I rarely do anymore. I hate that. And all it really does is shift my writing to FB & twitter comments, where they are much more ephmereal and unlikely to be read after the day they were written. And because of the nature of my FB use (lots of health/neurodiversity groups), that *really* sucks because I tend to put way too much time into those comments.

A digital garden is the perfect solution for me, as I can copy those comments over here and have them for expanding and cleaning up later-- and hopefully ideally turning into those polished bold posts (or evergreen posts in digital garden parlance) over time.

 In French, “cultiver son jardin intérieur” means to <em>tend to your internal garden</em>—to take care of your mind. The garden metaphor is particularly apt: taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits). On the surface, it’s a repetitive process. You need consistency and patience. But each day tending to your “mind garden” is different: discovering a new learning strategy, having a eureka moment, connecting the dots between two authors, getting involved in a lively conversation with an expert.
