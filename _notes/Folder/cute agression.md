# Cute Aggression

Cute aggression is a thing I absolutely experience a whole lot (for example, look at this, and at this! ‚Üí ME), but here it's just a play on words for a page where I can show off how I've **aggressively cute-ified my digital life** as a form of self-medication.

## The Internet
To change the look of websites I use [Stylus :: add0n.com](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)

### **Twitter**
I have made a LOT of lists on my [twitter](twitter.com/ameyawarde), but I never, ever remember to check them ([[ADHD: Out of Sight Out of Mind]]). üòû So, I was (overly) excited to find [MultiRow TweetDeck](https://multirow.page/), which allows you to stack columns so you can see most, if not all, of the things you want to see.  üòç My columns are a combo of main feed, lists, some tags I follow (#AcademicTwitter, #twitterhistorians) and my notifications. 

My current [tweetdeck.twitter.com](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) setup!
