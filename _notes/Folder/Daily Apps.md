# **Daily Apps**

## Obsidian

I found the [[note-taking]] / [[second brain]] app, **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** a couple weeks ago, and I'm already using it for this [[mind garden]], my notes for my [[research projects]], and an ever-growing list of other purposes. 

##### Theme:

Most of my vaults are customized versions of **[Moonlight](https://github.com/kartik-karz/moonlight-obsidian)  ** with the bold & blockquote bits from **[Obsidianite](https://github.com/TriDiamond/Obsidian-Obsidianite)** and using the colors from my [[color palettes|cute & bright color palette]].

##### Plugins

You can install community plugins from right inside Obsidian, which makes it easy to collect A WHOLE BUNCH.

- [Advanced Tables for Obsidian](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)
