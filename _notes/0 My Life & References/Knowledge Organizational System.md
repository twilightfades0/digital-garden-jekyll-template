### First Classification
***For a very small Library***

------------
#### **A** — Works of reference and works of a general character covering several classes
*Includes such works as are usually kept in the Delivery Room or the Reading Room for the free use of the public, such as the best dictionaries of languages and other subjects ; encyclopaedias, both general and special, handbooks of dates, dictionaries of biography and peerages, gazetteers, manuals of statistics, books of quotations, concordances, etc.*

-------------
### **B** — Philosophy and Religion
*Includes Moral philosophy.*

-------------
### **E** — Historical sciences
*Includes Biography, History, and Geography and Travels.*


But it is better to divide History into three classes, thus :

  **E** Biography
  To be arranged in the order of the persons whose lives are told. On distinguishing between the collective and the individual works see, forward, “ The method of arranging biography.”
  
  **F** History
  History includes the allied subjects: Antiquities, Inscriptions, Numismatics, Chivalry and Knighthood, Heraldry, Peerage.
  
  **G** Geography and Travels

-------------
#### **H** — Social sciences
*Includes Statistics, Political Economy, Commerce, the Poor, Charity, Education, Peace, Temperance, the Woman question, Politics, Government, Crime, Legislation, Law.*

-------------
#### **L** — Sciences and Arts, both Useful and Fine 

-------------
#### **X** — Language 

-------------
#### **Y** — Literature
*Includes Literary history, Bibliography, and the arts that have to do with books.*

-------------
#### **Yf** — Fiction
*To save time it is not unusual to omit the class-mark of the class Fiction, calling for and charging novels by the book-mark alone.*

I would probably recommend altering the letter system used here with something like Johnny Decimal: [https://johnnydecimal.com/](https://johnnydecimal.com/ "https://johnnydecimal.com/")(edited)


A system to organise projects.
