[Cute aggression](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-we-want-squeeze-cute-little-things-180971143/) is a very real and regular part of my life (can you stan puppies? my family definitely stans puppies.), and, while new  doesn't *quite* reach the level of cute aggression, I *have* recently started **aggressively cute-ifying my digital life.** Darkmode everywhere is nice for my eyeballs but terrible for my aesthetic sense + ADHD. Time for a change!



## **The Internet**
To change the look of websites I use [Stylus :: add0n.com](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)

#### **Twitter**
I have made a LOT of lists on my [twitter](twitter.com/ameyawarde), but I never, ever remember to check them ([[ADHD: Out of Sight Out of Mind]]). üòû So, I was (overly) excited to find [MultiRow TweetDeck](https://multirow.page/), which allows you to stack columns so you can see most, if not all, of the things you want to see.  üòç My columns are a combo of main feed, lists, some tags I follow (#AcademicTwitter, #twitterhistorians) and my notifications. 

My current [tweetdeck.twitter.com](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) setup!
