![DChamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20010106012100im_/http://www.thesitefights.com/knights/tips/jump1.gif)


There's only one way to find out. Submit your site.  
But before you do......  
Please take a minute to understand the  
guidelines.

(1) No adult material may be on your site.  
The Site Fights are intended to be enjoyable  
to the widest audience possible.  
This would include our children.

==(2) Understand the Spirit of the Fights.==  
The Site Fights are meant to be a positive experience.  
Therefore....we will not allow flaming of other sites.  
Although our name is The Site Fights, we really  
think of this as a friendly get together.  
A way to compare sites and see what the  
"everyday surfers really think" 

(3) Anything is possible.  
Just because your hit counter says a zillion trillion  
and you've been selected by every "so called award"  
in existence does not mean you are going  
to fly through The Site Fights.  
One of the most frequently asked questions is  
"How can David's Homepage be beating my Goliath Site?"  
I'd love to answer this question,  
but I don't have the answer.  
The Voters Do.

(4) Dman is the voice of the The Site Fights and its Spirit.  
He doesn't claim to be any type of minister  
and he will not pass around any offering baskets,  
but the "Spirit" truly does speak to him.  
The Site Fights Spirit is the  
most complex intangible.  
Not every rule is written, but all need to be understood.

(5) You are entering to have a little fun with your site.  
If you are not here to have fun, it will not be.  
Sure its great exposure,  
but Please don't let that be your only motivation.  
Have fun and be fair is all we ask.

(6) The rules are the same to all,  
to ensure that a Fighters creativity and spirit will be  
the focus.....

All ballots and votes must originate from the  
Site Fights.

(7) Sites Not Displaying a Link to the Site Fights,  
Will be considered as  
"having thrown in the towel",  
and removed from ballots on a timely basis.  
Its only fair, to the rest of the sites that provide  
a means of access for their regular surfers to  
go look at your site and vote for you,  
that you provide the same in return.  
The Site Fights are designed to bring  
ALL of our "fans and regular surfers" together  
to not only decide the Global Champion, but to also  
introduce them the other great sites and vice verse.

(8) The Site Fights reserves the right to remove  
any sites from The Site Fights process,  
without prior notice or reason.  
This is to insure the Spirit and quality of the Fights.  
Also regrettably has become necessary to insure  
fairness and fun for all involved.

(9) All Sites that join adhere to  
the guidelines prescribed by the Site Fights  
and the Ring/Team that they are joining.

Further more a Site cannot be part of more than one  
Ring/Team at any single given time.

(10) Completion of this form DOES NOTguarantee you a spot in the Site Fights.  
You also must be approved  
by our DPatrol.

(11) While emailing your friends to vote  is a nice idea, please do not spam!!

(12) Actual vote totals will not be released.

(13) NO bandwidth Stealing
All graphics,sound files, etc must be on your server.  
Displaying a graphic via a link is bandwidth stealing.

(14) Respect copyrighted material ... only take from  
stated public domain collections.
