# Daily Apps

---


## **Browsers**
I... use a lot of them. Useage for each one used to be more clearly deliniated; now it's just kind of whatever, to be honest. 

These days my main browser is [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge). When I [[starting fresh|made a fresh Windows account]] a month or two ago, I started playing with it just to, idk be silly/contrarian? because I assumed it was still essentially Internet Explorer, and ha, ha! What millenial uses Internet Explorer!?

But! Turns out Edge is basically just [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/),  with a couple different features, and it's definitely not IE! You can even use the chrome store and install chrome extensions. I do occasionally use chrome too (for functionality or because of logins, etc) but not very often.

I still really only use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for doing stuff with [[my current blogs|my wordpress sites]]. I don't use Firefox for this for any reason in particular, just because it's a different browser and thus can have a different bookmarks bar, and having a different browser for that more "worky" stuff, helps keep me from getting too distracted by the interwebs.

### **-> Chrome Store Extensions**

## **Obsidian**

I found the [[note-taking]] / [[Second Brain]] app, **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** a couple weeks ago, and I'm already using it for this [[Mind Garden]], my notes for my [[research projects]], and an ever-growing list of other purposes. 

![Screencap of the Obsidian website that says A second brain for you, forever. Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. | 550](https://i.imgur.com/vNVJr1S.png)

Here's an example of my workspace on my medical "Vault" (as Obsidian calls their instances): 

![screencap of my NerdyZebra Obsidian Vault|550](https://i.imgur.com/gbMKfKc.png)

Besides that vault, I have this one (the one I'm writing in, that pushes to Git & Jekyl/Netlifly), and another for my [[research projects|historical research]]. Actually a few of those, but I need to consolidate. Same with another private vault that can be combined with this one..

### **-> Plugins**

Most of my vaults are customized versions of **[Moonlight](https://github.com/kartik-karz/moonlight-obsidian)  ** with the bold & blockquote bits from **[Obsidianite](https://github.com/TriDiamond/Obsidian-Obsidianite)** and using the colors from my [[color palettes|cute & bright color palette]].

## **Atom **

I recently switched from [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), to [Atom](https://atom.io/) because, well, üòç ‚ú® s o  ‚≠ê p r e t t y ‚ú® üòç

### **-> Theme:**

### **-> Packages (plugins):**

## **Discord**
I spent the early 2010s using [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients), but that petered out after a cross-country move upended my schedule and I went a few years without any chatroom homes. Then last year I started using [Discord | Your Place to Talk and Hang Out](https://discord.com/), I think to join [[Sims 4]] servers, as [[covid-19|LongCovid]] & it's subsequent trash brain ground all my [[research projects]] to a halt for almost a full year. 

Besides Sims-related servers, I'm in (too) many servers about [[productivity]] (including individual apps), some academic interests, some super cute servers where I get my daily dose of ‚ú® [[c u t e ‚ú® s t u f f]].

>You can find discord servers for your own interests here: [Public Discord Servers | DISBOARD: Discord Server List](https://disboard.org/servers)
