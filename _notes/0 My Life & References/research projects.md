### Executive Dysfunction Research & Advocacy

Blurb to come. For now: [Executive Dysfunction Research & Advocacy | Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExecDysfunction)


### 19th c.(ish) Experimental Utopian Communities

Blurb also to come. I used to kind of talk about the researchy aspects of this project here-- [home(grad)schooling](https://homegradschooling.blogspot.com/)

## We've Always Been Here - Historical Figures & Neurodiversity

I recently started a side project that is currently "collecting" people & book exerpts of historical people that set my [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] radar off.  

```ad-warning
title: NOTE
collapse: open
content:
I will eventually write out an essay on why those who clutch their pearls at the idea of (")diagnosing("?) people in the past are wrong and often ableist, with a whole thing on the made-up nature of conditions themselves and the absurdity of treating things made up by some dudes back a LOT of discoveries ago, as actual, objective truth, YADDA YADDA. But that's gonna take a very long time, because I HAVE MANY THOUGHTS.
```




I read a lot of historical non-fiction/historical biographies, especially about science/scientistis and other topics that interest my own ND mind, so perhaps unsurprisingly it seems as if other NDs throughout history have gravitated towards these same subjects that I now read about and "see" them.


I love these biographies in general, but after a while the lack of disability/neurodiverse context for these people really started to wear on me. 

Presumable [[neurodiversity|neurotypical]] biographers sooo frequently misconstrue what, to me, someone who runs ND groups, live in an ND house, and reads tons of research on ND conditions, are **painfully obvious** autistic/ADHD traits.

Yet the authors don't see those traits for what they are (and what they *really* mean for that person/'s life) and they proceed to do the same thing that we autistic/ADHDers are all-too-familiar with: treat them as personal failures, bad choices, etc. These biographies can be riddled with ableism. I don't hold it (too much) against the author, as they obviously aren't understanding what they're looking at. But lots of us readers do. And we understand all the negative things they say about these same traits that most of us share. 

 At best, these traits, which are always brought up over and over again throughout the biographies (gee i wonder why?), are seen as neutral or even positive personality quirks. In these cases there's not ableism that I take issue with, it's just all the additional depth and analysis of this person and their life that seems so obviously missing as I listen.

These biographies are all incomplete.

And I want to help!

## CEO of Ameya Medical Research, Not-Inc.

I try to keep current and **read/review the latest research** for the "constallation of conditions" which comes along with my connective tissue disorder ([[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome|EDS]]). 

This includes, but is not limited to:

- [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]] (EDS)
- [[Dysautonomia]] (Incl. [[Neurocardiogenic Syncope|NCS]], [[Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome|POTS]])
- [[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome]] (MCAS)
- [[Eagle's Syndrome]] 
- [[Autism]]
- [[ADHD]]

And MANY more, including following citations and concepts into other papers from other fields, etc. 

I have recently started writing my notes about these papers, and moving old notes into a new [[Daily Apps#Obsidian|Obsidian]] project. As I go I [[note-taking#Atomized Notes|atomize]] them, making it easy to **make more and more connections **between conditions, symptoms, and both macro and micro biological components of the human body (and medications!). 

I'm really excited about the potential for discovery with this. There's not many researchers out there working on these connections, so there's an entirely real chance I can turn my own research reading into something useful. ü§ûüèª
