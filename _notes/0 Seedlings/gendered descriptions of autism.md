The autistic community has been trying to get away from gendered descriptions of autism. Afterall, where does that leave trans and nonbinary autistics? (Trans/non-binary and autism are actually very correlated!) Or the cismen who have that "female" presentation and thus can have equal trouble getting diagnosed, too? (my boyfriend fits that bill and was 40 when he finally was diagnosed!))
