> **CS:** Its earliest origin was as a failed children's book I tried to do back around 1985. I was doing the book on my own time, and came up with a character I thought was really fantastic and unique. It was the prototype for Stitch. He looked a little bit different, but he was pretty much Stitch in personality. I abandoned that because I realized the character was so subtle, there was no way to develop him successfully in 24 or 32 pages. I thought it was going to end up being too subtle, too intellectual. A great deal of writing was going to be needed to support that character, and that's a little bit contrary to a picture book. So it sat on the shelf...Around 1996, Tom Schumacher approached me and asked if I was interested in pitching a story, and so Stitch was revived.
