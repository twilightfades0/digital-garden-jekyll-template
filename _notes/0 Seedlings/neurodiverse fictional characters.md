<strong>CS:</strong> Its earliest origin was as a failed children's book I tried to do back around 1985. I was doing the book on my own time, and came up with a character I thought was really fantastic and unique. It was the prototype for Stitch. He looked a little bit different, but he was pretty much Stitch in personality. I abandoned that because I realized <mark>the character was so subtle, there was no way to develop him successfully in 24 or 32 pages. I thought it was going to end up being too subtle, too intellectual. A great deal of writing was going to be needed to support that character,</mark> and that's a little bit contrary to a picture book. So it sat on the shelf...Around 1996, Tom Schumacher approached me and asked if I was interested in pitching a story, and so Stitch was revived.
<p><strong>DD:</strong> <mark>Chris pulled out this character and the story that involved him,</mark> which was about an alien who had crash-landed in a forest and the other forest animals who had sort of left it alone.

 "I remembered a story from eighteen years before that I had tried to write as a children's book, but had given up on, because I couldn't compress it into a short story format. Over a sushi dinner at the Walt Disney World Swan Resort, I pitched that story -- <mark>a tale of a strange forest creature, shunned by all, and unaware of his own origins.</mark> Tom liked it, and when he suggested I relocate the tale of the lonely little monster into the human world, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> was born."
