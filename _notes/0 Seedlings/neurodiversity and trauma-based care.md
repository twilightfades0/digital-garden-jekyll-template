 I hate how hard it is to tell most of the trauma vs neurodiversity vs other mental health stuff. Trauma and resulting issues is absolutely 10000% real and important to research/know/treat/etc. And there is definitely trauma for many many neurodiverse people just living in a world not built for us (+ comorbidities making it even harder)

  

But also, there are soo few people in my ND groups who don't have a diagnosis of PTSD/Trauma-- even when they have nothing in their lives, or even prenatal/family that really accounts for it-- the therapists keep digging til they find \*something\* to peg as trauma causing, even if the person doesn't feel like it applies at all. Or like in my case, we have some trauma stuff, but then we do the work and process it and truly do heal. (But also we're way more likely to have PTSD for real as well because of predisposition and just the situations we find ourselves in etc etc) And then-- most of this stuff is genetic and so so much gets blamed on mothers/pregnancy, when really they do a shit job at controlling for the fact that maternal trauma during pregnancy might be because, again ND/people with mental health struggles are just more likely to be in those situations). But that's not to It's a big problem because of how much is \*not\* getting handled because of the focus on trauma -when- not appropriate.

  

It never ceases to surprise me how little science knows about all this stuff. and then practitioners know even less than that.
