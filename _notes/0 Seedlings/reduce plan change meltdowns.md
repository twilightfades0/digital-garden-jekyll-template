Here's what has helped us work on having fewer ragey-meltdowns in the last year or two since diagnosis:

  

\- learning more about autism and emotional dysregulation and cognitive flexibility (the executive function that is most impaired in autistics, which leads to difficulties switching tasks (or mindsets) and just generally makes plan changes and related things SO hard and anxiety(sometimes even \*pain!\*) inducing, as well as learning about anxiety in general (few of us manage to not have anxiety, though it can present very differently in people) has all helped, mostly via the rest:

  

\- learning coping skills for these situations online, especially in autism groups (for the reasons i listed in my other comment (plus more) most autism groups are self-diagnosis friendly -- and if a group isn't, you don't wanna be in there anyway tbh.) and blog posts/articles BY autistics!

  

\- on a day when you're feeling calm and up to it, think about the situations most likely to trigger a meltdown, and why you think that might be, and then brainstorm things that can be done to avoid them. Here I make extra sure to not surprise anyone with anything, am extra clear when situations might change so they can \*expect\* that plans can change, and stuff like that.

  

\- Both of them, and soon(again) my also autistic/adhd boyfriend too, are on guanfacine, which is a blood pressure med used super commonly offlabel to help with emotional dysregulation in autism & adhd and probably without either of those diagnoses too, since both are so underdiagnosed and so misunderstood, in adults especially.

  

FWIW even i, who normally have shutdowns instead, can get super upset by certain things, \*especially\*
