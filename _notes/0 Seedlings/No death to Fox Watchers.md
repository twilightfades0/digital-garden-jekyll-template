Too ADHD to make it through the rest of the comments here but like Saultie Weasel I don't know your relationship to our lovely OP here so I'll be nice but like, hey maybe that's a real douchebag opinion ü§∑üèª‚Äç Depersonalize it and I promise you I can hate on Fox News as well as you-- maybe more, since it's very personal for me-- but like maybe i don't want my fucking mother and grandmother and all my living elderly relatives to die?? Maybe, there's like-- more to being a fox news watcher than just being worthy of death?? ü§î

  

Conservative think tanks are extremely heavy on doing their thing via cognitive psychology/linguistics, and they literally send memos to fox news, among others, about how they should approach things and even what \*words\* they need to use when talking about it, etc, to make people believe them and think certain things. It is actual and intentional psychological manipulation at the highest level of behind-the-scence conservative powerbrokers. Plenty of fox news watchers are evil already, obviously. but countless people are how they are \*because\* they have been victims of this intentional cognitive manipulation.

  

My family is not brilliant, because ADHD & Co weren't known when they were in school so they sucked at it/my grandma literally went to a one room school house in the hills of kentucky and it maaaaybe it wasn't very intellectually rigorous. They have shockingly bad critical thinking skills in in many situations (and completely in politics). Genetics and biology absolutely play into this as well (I have lots of excellent pop-sci books on political psychology if you want a rec) Buuuut, you know, doesn't make them worthy of death? Being purposefully psychologically manipulated by evil fuckers is not an excutionable defense.
