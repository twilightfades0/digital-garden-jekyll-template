Joe Nabstedt Only petulant children get mad and refuse to do something because they were corrected. ü§∑üèª‚Äç This department answered excellently, others can too.

  

But if other departments gave up it wouldn't be much of a loss to be honest. Autism awareness as currently practiced is useless, and stresses autistics out more than it helps us (moms who hate dealing with us love to tell the world how hard we are to be around while sharing their blue and multicolored puzzle pieces this month. I'm also a mom with an autistic kid, so I do know what it's like and then some.)

  

What we really need acceptance, justice, and awareness of things beyond the fact that Autism is a thing that exists. Everyone knows that. But most people do not know much, if any, accurate and up to date information about what autism \*is,\* (even doctors are shockingly out of date), nor are people familiar with how autism may present (autistics, especially autistics of color, have a huge problem with people thinking they're on drugs and calling police just because of that, and it leads to very, very bad outcomes.)

  

Awareness ribbons don't teach that. Nor do they teach all the very \_different\_ presentations that autism may take, nor how our near ubiquitous anxiety may present (can be extremely different, and extreme in of itself- running away, extremely fidgety (which "looks suspicious"), freeze (difficulty answering/etc, can look "drugged", can get aggressive (ADHD is it's twin sister and most autistics (%s vary) have both, and that means impulse control can be a huge struggle).

  

Awareness stickers don't help all the countless autistics go undiagnosed (especially girls/women and people of color) because they don't "look" autistic, etc etc), or how to interact with autistics (plural, we're a diverse bunch with very different communication styles and needs), nor do they help create a world where we could actually thrive-- especially as adults. Did you know that unless you have concurrent intellectual disability or another condition that qualifies for various help, most autistic adults don't have a single service or program or anything to help us.

  

And puzzle piece stickers don't teach police departments how to navigate situations with autistics (and the various ways that may present!), how to spot meltdowns and sensory overloads, how to understand that just because someone can't make eye contact with you does NOT mean they are lying or suspicious, how to notice when there are communications issues and the autistic person is not understanding clearly, or is not being understood clearly etc etc. I cannot overstate how important that is, and how much it is lacking across the country/world.

  

Awareness stuff is meaningless as it's practiced now. It has the potential to be so much more, but isn't (yet?). So, if you're right, it wouldn't be much of a loss.

  

But, at least seeing something like this, I would think/hope that maybe, just maaaybe, this department may know at least some of the above. ü§ûüèª
