Here are the things that I used to get started in various aspects of BTS fandom, thanks to friends!

### My first exposure to BTS
I believe it was my cousin who I asked what I should watch, as I wanted to get into BTS. She recommended the following two videos (and it worked!)

### My Additions: 

#### English Talk Show Segments

I love seeing them on American talk shows (When I was ~20 and first into k-pop the idea of them being on shows I recognized would have been ðŸ¤¯!) so here are some of those, just because they were kind of annoying to go hunt down, might as well put them all here:
