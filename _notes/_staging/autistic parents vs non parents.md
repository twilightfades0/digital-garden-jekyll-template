It's weird how when the autistic children of the house (both adults are too) have meltdowns (&I promise, I'm a fucking wizard at avoiding them 98% of the time) I find myself angry at... fellow autistics.

There are too many non-autistic parents giving parenting advice online.





Like, it's a common parenting frustration when NT non-parents give NT parenting advice. But the autistic community is truly oblivious of this.

I don't begrudge people sharing their \*opinions\* & experiences. And autistic non-parent's opinion > non-autistic, non-parent's opinion.




But GD i wish autistic non-parents would stop thinking that growing up as an autistic makes your opinion as informed as autistic parents of autistic kids.'

We parents aren't experts either, but at least we have some experience.. & are just. So much more fucking chill/practical?




This is a not-subtweet to all the autistics who are like "kids don't need therapies! Their parents just need to parent better!"

Like, no, not always. Sometimes kids really, really, need some HEALTHY behavioral learning opportunities (OT, play therapy, etc (NOT aba, ffs))




Not everything is from bad parenting.

Not every parent has the training/time/materials/ability to understand the social dynamics happening to deal with certain issues.

Some kids don't understand that they are taking advantage of their own autistic parents & bullying them.
