That's a super common response to anxiety, and anxiety is a super common response to confusion/not knowing how to do a thing/overwhelm/frustration. Especially for "gifted"/ND kids (i question the difference for most of the former tbh) who aren't used to those feelings, even if they intellectually know those are okay things to feel. Often they don't even realize what they're feeling, as anxiety can be such a physical, straight-to-lizard-brain sensation, and generally kids are not great at recognizing when they're anxious for non-obvious reasons (monsters, roller coasters, the dark). I've always tried to work with both kids on recognizing their own anxiety when they feel it, and they're still not very good with it yet.

  

tho not a pro, I am very into psychology as well and so I've always been very conscious of the fixed vs growth mindset- just this week i was (re-)explaining that very concept to R! ..Yet still both boys here do the same avoidance thing, (though now at this age it also can include: "this is stupid!/ I hate this! / I'm stupid! / This is boring!(when its not)" etc)).

  

My brain is pure freeze&distract in response to anxiety. I have no worried thoughts or anything at \*all\*. I'm both chill af, and anxious af, lol. It's actually what lead my psych to realize i'm autistic ðŸ˜…. It's not in the least bit a thinking/conscious thing for me. Anxiety just causes freeze response and avoidance-- usually even unconscious/unintentional avoidance (anxiety makes my ADHD a million times worse so then I'm so distracted i entirely forget about the thing that was stressing me out!.. and a smol in this house who shall not be named does the exact same thing times a million (except it's less freeze and more "extra hyperactivity" response))

  

I'd definitely help him explore what is going on in his mind \*and\* body at those times when he's about to/does run away and approach it from more emotions and unconcious stuff. He may or may not recognize that he's having trouble with a certain thing, and may or may not really be conscious of \*why\* he's running away like that etc, which would explain why in these cases he isn't implementing the actions "keep trying!" or attitudes "it's okay to not know something!" that you both have taught him.

  

Anyway, that's not really advice so much as just throwing out a possibility. Sorry it was so long /if it makes no sense, i'm having a weird brain day today so words are both slipper and copious ðŸ˜….
