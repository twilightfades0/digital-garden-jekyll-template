title: Internet Nostalgia

I miss the internet of my early-aughts tween & teen years. Everything was **so** much more expressive and fun. Now everything is minimalist, monitized wordpress blogs and calendar-driven content creation so as not to anger the algorythmic gods.

Bleck.

And boring.

I don't want what you're selling (I'm poor, anyway). I just want to know about YOU. And your life! and your brain! 

Take me back to the days of personal websites with sporatically kept blogs and an abundance of cliques and webrings! I wanna see a list of fan buttons on your sidebar and links to silly myspace surveys that will only be read by people who want to put that survey on their own site. 

And what about real FORUMS?! Facebook groups B L O W. Discord is fun, but only for real-time discussions. I want discussion boards that clearly shows me what discussions are going on without any algorhythms choosing what I do and do not see. And I want admins who make their own rules and don't have to beg memebers not to report posts that violate the rules, lest [the whole group gets zucced](https://www.vice.com/en/article/597dnb/thousands-of-facebook-groups-go-secret-in-fear-of-the-great-zuccing).
