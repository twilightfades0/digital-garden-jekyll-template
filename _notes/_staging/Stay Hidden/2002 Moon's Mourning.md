**Moon's Mourning** 
July 30, 2002 

The faeries dance, 
And the earth laughs 
The moon smiles down 
Creatures gather 'round the fire, 
On the earthen mounds 

There is no thought of money or power or greed
They all know their place 
And there's nothing they need 

Yet through the festivities, there is one common tear 
An empty place, 
for a lost race 
The one they now fear 

It was long ago they left the dance 
Forgetting it with their won'ts and can'ts 
But the moon looks to them from up in the sky 
but the smile is gone and she begins to cry 

They cut down the trees and poison the land 
They think they are mighty Gods called "Man" 
Yet they trapped in establishments begun long ago 
Quietly the suffer, they assume no control 

The moon wonders why they cannot hear 
She sings to them that peace and love are near The world of old brings whispers in the wind 
But they dont hear it, and they fear the end Her tears fall down in the cold night sky 

They kiss all the people, as humanity dies 
She see the people who could save them all Someday they will come to hear their call 
And one day mankind can come and dance again 

They stay ignorant and away from the mounds 
But The faeries still dance, 
The earth still laughs 
And the moon smiles down They still notice the empty place 
And the race that needs refound.
