When i was a kid, i never told anyone, but i had significant gender distress. Like, cry myself to sleep because "God made me wrong". Id pray and pray trying to figure out why i "was put in the wrong body". I NEVER heard of trans folks at that age, nor had i heard the slightest suggestion that anyone on the planet had ever felt anything like it. I was very lonely and self-loathing.

  

I desperately wanted to be more girly and feel like a girl, so i actively tried to learn how. I took modeling classes! I read books! In first college i joined a sorority!

  

But at the same time, i took on a number of masculine nicknames. I eventually changed my name all together. The reasons?

  

The true reason I have always told people: "Ameya means "limitless/boundless" in Sanskrit and I wanted to remind myself to not try to stuff myself in the boxes I'm "supposed" to be in."

  

The additional reason that I didn't tell people: "It's a boy's name." But it \*sounds\* like a girls name to Americans.

  

I dont know how to define my pre-puberty self, but I can easily see that, had i the language, my post puberty but pre-pregnancy self almost certainly would have identified as non-binary.
