## Stock over flow

>..this seminal piece from Robin Sloan: [stock and flow](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890). Robin lays out (in 2010!) the concept of stock and flow:
>
> >**Flow is the feed**. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.
>
> > **Stock is** the durable stuff. It’s **the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months** (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.

And is clear not to deride flow - it’s the currency of the modern world - but rather to ensure you’re well-balanced:

> You can tell that I want you to stop and think about stock here. I feel like we all got really good at flow, really fast. But flow is ephemeral, while stock sticks around. Stock is capital. Stock is protein.

> And the real magic trick is to put them both together. To keep the ball bouncing with your flow—to maintain that open channel of communication—while you work on some kick-ass stock in the background. Sacrifice neither. The hybrid strategy.


## A blog without a publish button

>I’m stealing this quote from my modern friend [Ryan Dawidjan](https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan)...

>It’s a less-performative version of blogging - more of a captain’s log than a broadcast blog.

>The distinction will come down to how you blog - some people blog in much the same way. For me however blogging is mostly _performative thinking_ and less captain’s log. So I am looking for a space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking.


## A space for collecting the dots

>This one might be the most important. 
>
>Creative **research is all about collecting the dots**. 
>
>It’s more common to think of “connecting the dots” but the truth is that *you can’t connect the dots you can’t see*. 
>
>And we can *only hold a tiny number of things in our brains at once*. 
>
>So** a space for collecting (and organizing) the dots is a crucial foundation for thinking**, creativity and more:
>
>
>> But ideas aren’t summoned from nowhere: they come from raw material, other ideas or observations about the world. 
>> 
>> Hence a two-step creative process: 
>> - **collect** raw material, 
>> - then **think** about it. 
>> 
>> From this process comes pattern recognition and eventually the insights that form the basis of novel ideas. <cite> - [capstone, a tablet for thinking](https://www.inkandswitch.com/capstone-manuscript.html)  </cite>


## Longevity, text files and folders

>The lightbulb moment for me came by connecting two ideas together:
>
>Firstly - apparently, folders and files is the “best in class” tool (better than tags and search) for personal information management :
>
> >Bergman and Whittaker report that many of us use hierarchical folders for our personal digital organizing. 
> >
> >Critics of this method point out that information is hidden from sight in folders that are often within other folders so that we have to remember the exact location of information to access it. 
> >
> >Because of this, information scientists suggest other methods: 
> >- search, more flexible than navigating folders; 
> >- tags, which allow multiple categorizations; 
> >- and group information management. 
> >
> >Yet Bergman and Whittaker have found in their pioneering personal information management research that **these other methods** that work best for public information management **don’t work as well for personal information management**.
