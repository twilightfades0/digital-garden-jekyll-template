Title: LN- Brief History of the Digital Garden

Appleton, Maggie. “A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden.” _Maggie Appleton_, 10 June 2020, maggieappleton.com/garden-history.

>Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites \[blogs\] act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.
>
>They're collections of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.
>
>They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing. It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "_should be_." It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined.

### A Brief History of Digital Gardens
####  The Early Gardens of Hypertext

>Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay [Hypertext Gardens](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html) appears to be the first recorded mention of the term \[digital garden\].

> "A WikiGardener plants things, tend, prunes, tidies and generally nurtures. A WikiGnome fixes small flaws and does little maintenance jobs. Both are essential, but I aspire to be a WikiGardener." 
> <cite>- [Wiki Gardener (c2.com)](https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGardener)</cite>

#### Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors

> At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on [The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo). It later becomes [a hefty essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. If anyone should be considered the original source of _digital gardening_, it's Caufield. They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.
> - Good ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.

> Caufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by _streams_  – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events. The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments.
> 
> [..] But streams only surface the Zetigeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time.


> It's hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.

.

>Tom Critchlow's 2018 article [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) was one of the main kick-off points. Tom read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add _campfires_ to the idea of streams and gardens – the private Slack groups, casual blog rings, and [Cozy Web](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web) areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.

#### Amy Hoy's How the Blog Broke the Web

> In it, she explores the history of blogs over the last three decades, and pinpoints exactly when we all became fixated on publishing our thoughts in reverse chronological order (spoiler: around 2001 with the launch of [Moveable Type](https://www.movabletype.org/)).

> Amy argues that Moveable Type didn't just launch us into the " **Chronological Sort Era**". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts. Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML & CSS yourself.

#### Developer-led Gardening

> However, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the [information architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture) and spatial layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't "count," as "real" gardens, but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts, or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building materials.


### The Six Patterns of Gardening

#### 1. Topography over Timelines

>Gardens are don't use chronology as their main organising rule. They're **organised by contextual relationships**. The concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others. Notes link to other notes that touch on similar themes and topics. One of the best ways to do this is through [Bi-directional Links](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) – links that make both the destination page and the source page visible to the reader.

#### 2. Continuous Growth

> Digital gardening is _low friction_ - tending it shouldn't take more effort than a Tweet. Just like a real garden, watering and clipping it is part of a daily ritual.

> Over the last decade, writing on the web has moved away from casual blog posts and live journal entries. We now publish "articles" and "essays" that are carefully crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it's done it's done.


#### 3. Learning in Public & Imperfection

> Our current understanding of blogging is highly performative. The [Premium Mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) culture of Millenialism defined the last decade of blogging as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content.

> Weird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns.

>Digital gardening is the [Domestic Cozy](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/domestic-cozy/) version of the professional personal blog. It's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than our Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather than engage in banter and quippy conversations.

> Blog posts present an established opinion. Garden notes present a set of loose ideas that don't know what they think yet.

#### 4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental

>Personal gardens are about **contextualisation**.

>A 240 character bio on Twitter, or a fill-in-the-form profile on Facebook limits the scope of how we present ourselves. The platform picks the categories it deems important - relationship status, gender, hometown.

#### 5. Intercropping & Content Diversity

>All varieties of mediums grow in the garden - videos, podcasts, short notes, long essays, academic papers, sketche

#### 6. Independent Ownership
>A large part of gardening is claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control.

>No one can take your garden away. If you give it a bit of forethought – storing notes in flat markdown files – you can built it in a way that easily transfers as platforms and technologies inevitably change.
