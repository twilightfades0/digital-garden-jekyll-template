> Loosely speaking - streams are for fast twitch thinking and acting.


>[This piece from Mike Caulfield](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) .. How do we build and maintain our own personal information gardens? Not streams - but environments we can tend and grow over decades:
>
>> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, **the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.**
>>
> >[..] Every walk through the garden creates new paths, new meanings, and when we add things to the garden we add them in a way that allows many future, unpredicted relationships
>


>The Garden - vs the Stream:
>
>> In the stream metaphor you don’t experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end. You jump in and let it flow past. You feel the force of it hit you as things float by.
>
>> It’s not that you are passive in the Stream. You can be active. But your actions in there — your blog posts, @ mentions, forum comments — exist in a context that is collapsed down to a simple timeline of events that together form a narrative.
>
>> In other words, the Stream replaces topology with serialization. Rather than imagine a timeless world of connection and multiple paths, the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center.


## Stream, Campfires and Gardens

>So as I’m reading these pieces it strikes me that I consume & produce information as follows:
>
>**Streams** \- mostly Twitter for me, this is where fast twitch information discovery happens. The firehose of content. 
>
>**Campfires** \- mostly blogging for me, though I know some folks gather around private slack groups too. 
>- My blog functions as a digital campfire (or a series of campfires) that are slower burn but fade relatively quickly over the timeframe of years. 
>- Connection forming, thinking out loud, self referencing and connection forming. This builds muscle, helps me articulate my thinking and is the connective tissue between ideas, people and more.
>
>**Gardens** \- This is the wiki layer Michael references above and I don’t think I have any real solution here. Where is the tool to curate, connect and explore information? Where is my personal learning curriculum? This decades-spanning project of information sensemaking is missing for me but seems appealing. Are.na, Pinboard, Evernote and Pocket all fill some portion of this gap for me but none of them are building a garden I can maintain…
