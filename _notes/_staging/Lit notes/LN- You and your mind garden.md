> In French, “cultiver son jardin intérieur” means to _tend to your internal garden_ —to take care of your mind. 
> 
> The garden metaphor is particularly apt: taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits).


>On the surface, it’s a repetitive process. You need consistency and patience. But each day tending to your “mind garden” is different: discovering a new learning strategy, having a eureka moment, connecting the dots between two authors, getting involved in a lively conversation with an expert.


>“So plant your own gardens and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.” — Jorge Luis Borges


## A gardening guide for your mind

> First, you need to seed your mind garden with quality content. 
> - reading a research paper will probably give you deeper insights into a specific scientific process and the methods behind the team’s findings, 
> - whereas reading a book about a broader topic will give you lots of superficial nuggets of information.
> - - Reading broad content is also a way to plant many seeds, which you may decide to nurture or not in the future.
> - Having a diverse information diet is more important than striving for an unattainably perfect information diet.


>When consuming content, grow branches on your knowledge tree by [taking notes](https://nesslabs.com/note-taking). 
>
>Short notes, long notes—it doesn’t matter as much as **writing your thoughts in your own words.** 
> - That’s called the [generation effect](https://nesslabs.com/generation-effect), and it states that you better remember information when you create your own version of it.


> A mind garden is not a mind backyard. It’s not about dumping notes in there and forgetting about them. To tend to your garden, you need to plant new ideas. The best way to do this is by replanting stems and cuttings from existing ideas you’ve added to your garden—by consistently taking notes, and combining them together, a bit like grafting[..]. 
> 
> Sometimes, two seemingly remote or even incompatible ideas will give birth to a new insight. (look at the pomato, a weird hybrid of tomato and potato)

## Creating a digital garden

> 1.  Your note-taking app, such as [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/nesslabs/search) or one of its [open source alternatives](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-alternatives) for instance, can be used for collating snippets, ideas, and raw thinking. Use it to seed your garden and connect the dots.
2.  Once you have managed to articulate a new idea (new to you at least), write down a few more structured sentences, and add it to your digital garden as an evergreen note.
3.  You can stop here, but for people who have a proper blog or a newsletter, you may want to publish longer essays there.


> Ultimately, the goal is to make sure all the information you consume (your input) can lead to increased productivity and creativity (your output) instead of festering and getting forgotten in your mind backyard.
