>You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people "learn in private", and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves. 

>Again, that's fine, but we're here to talk about being in the top quintile. What you do here is to have **a habit of creating learning exhaust**:
>
>- Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets.
>- Speak at meetups and conferences.
>- Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discord, they're not public.
>- Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams.
>- Start a newsletter.
>- Draw cartoons ([people](https://code-cartoons.com/) [loooove](https://wizardzines.com/) [cartoons](https://arkwright.github.io/scaling-react-server-side-rendering.html)!).
>
>Whatever your thing is, **make the thing you wish you had** found when you were learning. 
>
>Don't judge your results by "claps" or retweets or stars or upvotes - **just talk to yourself from 3 months ago**. 


> But chances are that _by far_ the biggest beneficiary of you trying to help past you is _future you_. If others benefit, that's icing.
>

>-   Enjoyed a coding video? Reach out to the speaker/instructor and thank them, and ask questions.
>-   Make PR's to libraries you use.
>- Make your own libraries no one will ever use.
>- **Clone stuff you like, from scratch, to see how they work**
>- Teach workshops.
>- Go to conferences and summarize what you learned.


>If you're tired of creating one-off things, start building a persistent knowledge base that grows over time. [Open Source your Knowledge](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/open-source-knowledge/)! At every step of the way: _Document what you did and the problems you solved._

>Try your best to be right, but don't worry when you're wrong. Repeatedly. If you feel uncomfortable, or like an impostor, good. You're pushing yourself. Don't assume you know everything, but try your best anyway, and let the internet correct you when you are inevitably wrong. Wear your noobyness on your sleeve.


>At some point you'll get some support behind you. People notice genuine learners. They'll want to help you. Don't tell them, but they just became your mentors. 
>
>**This is very important: [Pick up what they put down](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public-hack)**. 
>- Think of them as offering up quests for you to complete. When they say "Anyone willing to help with **\_\_** **\_\_**?" you're that kid in the first row with your hand already raised. 
>-  They'll spend time with you, 1 on 1, if you help them out (p.s. and there's always something they want help on). You can't pay for this stuff. They'll teach you for free. Most people don't see what's right in front of them. But not you.


>"With so many junior devs out there, why will they help _me_?", you ask.
>
**Because you learn in public.** By teaching you, they teach many. You amplify them. 
>
>You have one thing they don't: a beginner's mind. You see how this works?


>At some point people will start asking you for help because of all the stuff you put out. 
>- 80% of developers are "dark", they dont write or speak or participate in public tech discourse. 
>- But you do. You must be an expert, right? Don't tell them you aren't. Answer best as you can, and when you're stuck or wrong pass it up to your mentors.
>
>Eventually you run out of mentors, and just solve things on your own. You're still putting out content though. You see how this works?


>p.s. Eventually, they'll want to pay you for your help too. A lot more than you think.
