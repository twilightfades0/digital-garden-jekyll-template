Title: LN- Stop Giving af and Start Writing More

>In 2019, I stumbled into the idea of treating this space like a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)..

## It's not a fucking blog.

>Seriously. The idea of a "blog" needs to get over itself. Everybody is treating writing as a "content marketing strategy" and using it to "build a personal brand" which leads to the fundamental flawed idea that everything you post has to be polished to perfection and ready to be consumed.
>
>Bullshit.
>
This idea is toxic and led me to publish less and less over time.

>Instead my approach now is to publish my thoughts more freely with less premeditation. Particularly in **this** space, which is mine, for me, by me.
>
>I don't lose the freedom to publish more polished work, it's just not my own personal expectation.



## No More Analytics

> While we are talking about toxic practices, analytics might get top billing.
>
>"I'm using analytics to monitor what content performs well for my audience."
>
>ðŸ¤®

>For me this is a shitty optimization. Instead I'd like to optimize for being useful and interesting to both you **and myself**.
>
>Being useful for me is the primary use case for this space on the internet. It's not that I don't care about you, but this is for me. It's here so I can record what I think and know and preserve it in time and space.
>
>It's my garden, but I'm happy for you to hang around and eat tomatos with me.


## Building a Second Brain

>What are you doing with the vast quantities of information you are consuming on a daily basis?
>
>Tweets, blogs, videos, tik toks, reddit comments, hacker news thread, cable news, books...
>
Where does it all go?



>..you sit down to "blog" and your stuck sitting there with "writers block" until you click away from the editor and go back to binging some new show on Disney+ (or whatever) with a promise to yourself that you'll blog better next week.

>This year I started using Tiago Forte's Second Brain techniques to catalog and store all the shit I'm researching, reading, listening to, watching, and otherwise spending my days consuming.
>
>It all gets shoved into my Second Brain for search and retrieval when I'm ready.

>Tools like Notion and Roam have become **extra ram** that I store the things I'm interested in in.
>
>I clip the whole text into these tools, highlight, add commments and context, cross-reference, and summarize in an incremental way.
>
>Tiago calls this technique [Progressive Summarization](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes-3459b257d3eb/), and I'm here to tell you it's fantastic.
>
>All of these things together have meant that when I sit down to write, it's painless. I have ideas. I have a great system. It's mostly friction free.
