## Why We Need a Terms of Service

> The [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public) movement has encouraged thousands of people to write, speak, draw, or otherwise _pick up what mentors put down_, with the end goal of lifelong [`L(N*P)` growth in personal knowledge and network](https://www.swyx.io/writing/big-l-notation/). A key part of this strategy is maintaining your own Digital Garden.

>  
It is in part a trick for creators to play on themselves: For perfectionists who stress over shipping anything less-than-polished and therefore never ship anything, it is a license to trade off self review for peer review and increased velocity. 
>
>Many report both improved quality and quantity of output after giving themselves the permission to do this.


## Potential Problems with Digital Gardens

>   We have been conditioned for decades to believe in the finality and authority of the printed word. The widely accepted Rules of Good Writing exhort writers to use active voice and drop weasel words.


## Safe Space for Gardeners

> People with audiences do of course have some obligation to not do them a disservice, else they don't deserve that audience. 
> 
> However this *doesn't mean that they must do exhaustive due diligence and be authoritative in every context *
> 
->  there needs to be space to experiment, grow, and quite frankly, be ignorant and wrong.
