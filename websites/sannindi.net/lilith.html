<b>Lilith Rituals </b>
<p>

Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping <br>
Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star. ,br>
Lone on the fir-branch his rattle-note unvaried, <br>
Brooding o'er the gloom, spins the brown eve-jar.<br> 
~George Meredith

Lilith is the Divine Lady Owl and the original bad-ass chick, the
archetypal seductress and the personification of the dangerous feminine
glamour of the Moon. Lilith is the wanton winged goddess of erotic
dreams. She is a symbol of the forbidden pleasures and beguiling
sorcery. Is it any wonder she is so popular nowadays?
<p>

Our most familiar image of Lilith comes from a terra-cotta relief from
Sumer, dated to around 2000 B.C. Her, she is depicted as an attractive,
winged woman with clawed feet, surrounded by owls and standing on two
lion that face in opposite directions.
<p>

Generally speaking, Lilith has ties to the mythologies of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Hebrew cultures. To the Babylonians she was known as Lilitu; to the Sumerians, Bellit-illi or Belili. A Sumerian fragment recorded her name and described Lilith as a maiden, "the hand of Innana." She was sent by Innana to bring men into the temple, In Hebrew mythology, who was known as a screech owl or night hag.
<p>

Lilith was the first wife of Adam, and she demanded equality in all
things. When she refused to lie submissive beneath him, Adam complained
to his creator about Lilith's "shrewish" behaviour. Having had enough,
Lilith spoke the hidden name of God and flew away to her home in the Red Sea. the more docile Eve was created to take her place.
<p>

Lilith was also associated with the Queen of Sheba, and in medieval
France she was known as La Reine Perauque, which translates, "the queen
with the bird's foot." Lilith was thought to fly at night along with her twelve daughters, the Lilim. Together, the enticed young men who slept.
<p>

To modern Witches and Pagans, Lilith is a patroness of Witches and
goddess of the waning Moon. Lillith was described by the author Doreen
Valiente in her book ABC of Witchcraft, as an enticing sorceress, a
beautiful vampire, and the ultimate femme fatale. Lilith stands for
desire, pleasure, and sexual love - not for the purpose of procreation
but simply for the enjoyment. Besides her obvious associations with
sexuality, Lilith represents wisdom, renewal, equality, feminine power,
and independence. Lility encourages us to live on our own terms. She is
a powerful role model for women, and as long as we remember that sex,
like magic, should never be used to coerce, harm, or control another
person in any way, we can use Lilith energy to improve our lives and
relationships.
<p>

Lilith's sacred animals are the owl and the lion. Owl magick or medicine has an interesting connection to Lility. Because it has a noiseless flight, the owl traditionally symbolizes secrets, wisdom, and silence. The owl swoops silently down on prey, just as Lilith was believe to, and so people who carry the owl as a totem animal often are a little spookier than average. Their natural clairvoyance leads them to perceive and detect what other folks want to keep hidden.

<b>Lilith Clairvoyance</b>
<p>

People who are close to Lilith therefore often experience an owl-like
insight, seeing pictures or receiving images of people and places,
Learning to control this "talent," for those of us who have always had
it, takes effort and discipline. Being a clairvoyant, though it can be
useful, is not always a barrel of laughs - many images can be
overwhelming and or disturbing. When I was younger I couldn't even shake a person's hand without receiving a fast shuffle of images and feelings. I had no type of shield or buffer to mitigate the swirl of emotions. When I began to avoid touching anybody, people misinterpreted that as being rude or snobbish. It wasn't until I grew older that I learned a few shielding techniques to protect myself.
<p>

For instance, learning to work with owl medicine was a great help to me.The owl is all-seeing, certainly, but she is also wise enough to be
still, and to watch and wait. Furthermore, working with dark goddess
energy taught me the value of acceptance. If you need help learning to
deal with yourself just as you are, then Lilith can be a powerful ally.
