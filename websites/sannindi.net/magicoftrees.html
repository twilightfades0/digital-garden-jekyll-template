<b>The Magick of Trees</b>
<p>

Trees have been considered to be magickal for many centuries. They have
been the homes of wood spirits and the keepers of sacred circles. Many
tales of the part trees have played in witchcraft and the occult were
told to young children, such as the admonition to avoid old oak trees or
groves of oaks. These were places witches met and were filled with much
power. Even today some of the old tales live on in superstitions such as
'knock on wood'. So you may ask if there is any truth to these tales,
for all legends have some basis in truth. 
<p>

Well for the Wiccan or Neo-Pagan trees are a source of power because they are rooted in the
Mother Earth and they reach to the heavens. This is the essential
posture we humans seek in trying to reach a state of balance during
meditation. We visualize a stream of energy from the Earth flowing up
into us, as a stream of energy flows into us from above. Trees are in
this state all the time and are therefore a very natural source of power
for magick. Most any tree can be used for magickal purposes, though
certain trees seem better suited to certain forms of Magick.
<p>

There are lists called tables of correspondences, which contain specific
colours, smells, tastes, plants, and sounds associated with certain
emotions and concepts. There are also trees listed in some of these.
Examples of trees used in certain situations include the following:
<p>

<b>APPLE</b>...Healing, Prosperity, Love, Youth <br>
<b>BIRCH</b>...Protection, Fertility New Beginnings<br>
<b>CYPRESS</b>...Past Lives<br>
<b>MAPLE</b>...Divination, Love<br>
<b>OAK</b>...Healing, Strength, Money<br>
<b>PINE</b>...Purification, Health, Prosperity<br>
<b>WILLOW</b>...Enchantments, Wishing
<p>

As you can see, for those of us who live on the Eastern Shore of
Maryland, there are many trees which we can use in magickal work. So how
does one tap into this wealth of power. One way is to let the tree help
in 'recharging' you after a long day or after an extremely emotional
event. A simple procedure for doing this follows. 
<p>

---------------------------
<p>

Pick a tall, straight tree such as a pine. Generally you should try to feel the tree's spirit
to see if it seems welcoming to you. Once you've found a tree you feel
comfortable with, walk once around it clockwise (If you so choose) saying 
<p>

'Great tree, <br>
Ancient of the Earth,  <br>
Will you grant and give my strength rebirth?' 
<p>

Now sit on the ground with your back straight and pressed against the tree.
As you sit, feel the power running between the Earth and sky through the
tree. See your body surrounded by the aura of the tree and feel this
power filling you with renewed strength. You may at this point even
begin to actually 'hear' the tree speaking to you. A wise person will
listen to it's wisdom. Once you feel rested and renewed, rise slowly and
thank the tree for helping you regain your balance and strength. A gift
to the tree is not inappropriate. One way of doing this would be to bury
a coin or something of value at the base of the tree. Care should be
taken not to injure the tree in the process of burying the item. 
<p>


---------------------------

<p>

This is but one way of having trees aid you in your daily life. There are many
others to be found in various books on Earth/Nature magick. I hope you
will explore the many possibilities further. The only advice I can offer
is to remember you are dealing with a living spirit and that you should
avoid harming the tree. Have fun with your experiments and enjoy the new
friendships to be found in trees.
