# Welcome! 🌱

<p class="box">
This [[Mind Garden|mind garden/digital garden]] / [[second brain]] is my attempt to <a href="https://www.mentalnodes.com/the-only-way-to-learn-in-public-is-to-build-in-public">learn in public</a>. Think of it like a busy <a href="https://harry-potter-compendium.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve">pensieve</a> for thoughts and ideas <small>(ps rowling ❌🙅‍♀️, trans folks ✔️🎉).</small>
</p>





Here you'll find some of my thoughts, ideas, info about my [[Daily Apps|digital]] [[DigitalCustomization|world]], etc. Honestly a lot of it will be posts that started as FB comments but got too long so I moved them over here.

Things here are unedited, unfinished--but that's what reduces the anxiety to write something perfect, and much more writing can get done.
